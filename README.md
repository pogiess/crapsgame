Craps is a dice game in which players bet on the outcomes of the roll of a pair of dice.
Players can wager money against each other (playing "street craps") or against a bank ("casino craps"). 
Because it requires little equipment, "street craps" can be played in informal settings. 

Here are the basic rules of the game:

1. The game starts with a player rolling two dice.
2. If the player rolls a 7 or 11 on the first roll, they win.
3. If the player rolls a 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll, they lose.
4. If the player rolls any other number on the first roll (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), that number becomes their "point".
5. The player then continues to roll until they either roll their point again (in which case they win) or they roll a 7 (in which case they lose).
